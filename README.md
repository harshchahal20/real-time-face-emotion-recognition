Developed a real-time face reaction recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, to capture video and predict emotions in real-time. 
The project involved a full machine learning workflow, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training and deployment.
Utilized Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, and OpenCV to build and train the model.
Acquired and processed a dataset of 36,000 facial images.
Built and trained a CNN model to accurately classify reactions like happy, sad, angry, etc with an accuracy of 83%.
